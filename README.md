# 🧠 Evan Bhandari – Terminal Portfolio

An interactive **terminal-style personal portfolio website** built with modern frontend technologies.  
All the code was generated using **Figma Make** and **ChatGPT** none of the source code was written manually.

## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases a unique terminal-inspired interface where users can explore different sections of the site (About, Works, Experience, Contact, etc.) through typed commands.  

Commands such as `whoami`, `ls`, `cd`, and `socials` reveal different information in a dynamic, responsive layout.
